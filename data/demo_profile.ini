; Copy and save it as a different file in the same folder,

; could always come back to this demo_profile.ini and make
; a clean copy.
;
; To edit your copy of this file, only edit the numbers,

;
; In the [Assets] section, enter the current value and
; growth rate for each of the four types of accounts
; typically held at your financial brokerage. If you have
; multiple accounts of the same type, add them up and
; use the total value and average growth rate. The value
; is a whole dollar amount, and the average growth rate
; is a fractional number in the range of [0, 0.3]
;
; In the [General] section, enter the current annual cost
; of living (i.e. what goes out of the pocket),
; contributions to ROTH and 401k, takehome job income
; (after taxes and contributions). If you have
; different types of contributions, put anything pre-tax
; into the 401k line, and anything post-tax into the roth
; line. It is further assumed that remaining takehome
; income after expenses goes into your individual invest-
; ment asset. The vaule of cost, income, contributions,
; and pension income are in whole dollar annual amounts, 
; the inflation rate is a fractional number in the range
; of [0, 0.3], and years till retirement, withdrawal and
; pension are whole numbers in the range of [0, 50]. If
; any of the values are not applicable, set them to 0 but
; do not delete the line.
